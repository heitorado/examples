# Color Dodge Game

Made by [Heitorado](https://github.com/heitorado)

**Ruby2D Version:** 0.6.0

Feel free to use and modify as you wish!

## Controls:
    W, A, S, D to move the little yellow ball around

## How to play:
    Try to survive the endless wave of colored squares!
    Stay alive as long as you can and your score will go up!
    Touch sufficient colored squares to empty your life bar and you'll have to start again!

Maybe not the best way to implement it, but it shows what can be achieved with the ruby2dgem.
Help me improve, send suggestions about the code!
